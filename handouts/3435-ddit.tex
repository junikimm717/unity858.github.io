We are lazy, so here is a problem compilation, one of the shortest handouts of all time.
\begin{block}[Very brief blurb]
Desargues was a sinner, a mastermind spinner,\\
Mathematical genius, his thoughts got much bigger.\\
With lines and planes, he played his wicked game,\\
Geometry was his realm, and he conquered the terrain.\\[6pt]

He twisted and turned, in his mathematical maze,\\
Proving the theorems that left others amazed.\\
His mind was a canvas, where concepts would collide,\\
Creating new dimensions, in which truths would reside.\\[6pt]

From perspective, he derived his duality,\\
Projective geometry, his art with clarity.\\
He saw the world in a different light,\\
Unveiling hidden symmetries, day and night.\\[6pt]

Desargues danced with angels and demons alike,\\
Challenging the norms, never afraid to strike.\\
His sins were his passion, his rebellion was clear,\\
In a world of shapes and numbers, he had no fear.\\[6pt]

So raise a toast to Desargues, the sinner with a vision,\\
Whose mathematical legacy defies all derision.\\
For in his wickedness, he found the truth,\\
And left us with a geometric marvel, in our youth.\\

\section{Opening examples}
\begin{block}[Example 1 (OMMC Main 2023/24 by Tiger)]
Define acute $\triangle ABC$ with circumcenter $O$. The circumcircle of $\triangle ABO$ meets segment $BC$ at $D \ne B$, segment $AC$ at $F \ne A$, and the Euler line of $\triangle ABC$ at $P \ne O$. The circumcircle of $\triangle ACO$ meets segment $BC$ at $E \ne C$. Let $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{FP}$ intersect at $X$, with $C$ between $B$ and $X$. If $BD=13$, $EC=8$, and $CX=27$, find $DE$.

Approximately increasing difficulty....
\exercise[USA TST 2004/4] Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Choose a point $D$ in its interior. Let $\omega_1$ be a circle passing through $B$ and $D$ and $\omega_2$ be a circle passing through $C$ and $D$ so that the other point of intersection of the two circles lies on $AD$. Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ intersect side $BC$ at $E$ and $F$, respectively. Denote by $X$ the intersection of $DF$, $AB$ and $Y$ the intersection of $DE, AC$. Show that $XY \parallel BC$.
\exercise[CJMO 2021/1]Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle, and let the feet of the altitudes from $A$, $B$, $C$ to $\overline{BC}$, $\ol{CA}$, $\ol{AB}$ be $D$, $E$, $F$, respectively. Points $X\neq F$ and $Y\neq E$ lie on lines $CF$ and $BE$ respectively such that $\angle XAD = \angle DAB$ and $\angle YAD = \angle DAC$. Prove that $X$, $D$, $Y$

\exercise[IGO 2018/I5]Suppose that $ABCD$ is a parallelogram such that $\angle DAC = 90^o$. Let $H$ be the foot of perpendicular from $A$ to $DC$, also let $P$ be a point along the line $AC$ such that the line $PD$ is tangent to the circumcircle of the triangle $ABD$. Prove that $\angle PBA = \angle DBH$. 
\exercise[Serbia 2017/6] Let $k$ be the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$ and let $k_a$ be A-excircle .Let the two common tangents of $k,k_a$ cut $BC$ in $P,Q$.Prove that $\angle PAB=\angle CAQ$.
\exercise[Taiwan TST 2014/3/3]Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Gamma$ and let $M$ be an arbitrary point on $\Gamma$. Suppose the tangents from $M$ to the incircle of 
$\triangle ABC$ intersect $\ol{BC}$ at two distinct points $X_1$ and $X_2$. Prove that the circumcircle of triangle $MX_1X_2$ passes through the tangency point of the 
$A$-mixtilinear incircle with $\Gamma$.
\exercise[USA TST 2018/5 (by Evan)] Let $ABCD$ be a convex cyclic quadrilateral which is not a kite, but whose diagonals are perpendicular and meet at $H$. Denote by $M$ and $N$ the midpoints of $\overline{BC}$ and $\overline{CD}$. Rays $MH$ and $NH$ meet $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{AB}$ at $S$ and $T$, respectively. Prove that there exists a point $E$, lying outside quadrilateral $ABCD$, such that
\begin{itemize}
  \item ray $EH$ bisects both angles $\angle BES$, $\angle TED$, and
  \item $\angle BEN = \angle MED$.
\end{itemize}
\exercise[IMO 2019/2] In triangle $ABC$, point $A_1$ lies on side $BC$ and point $B_1$ lies on side $AC$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be points on segments $AA_1$ and $BB_1$, respectively, such that $PQ$ is parallel to $AB$. Let $P_1$ be a point on line $PB_1$, such that $B_1$ lies strictly between $P$ and $P_1$, and $\angle PP_1C=\angle BAC$.

Prove that $P,Q,K$ are collinear. (The Kosnita point is the point at which the line through $A$ and the circumcenter of $\triangle BOC$ and the other two analogous lines concur; it is the isogonal conjugate of the nine-point center. 
\exercise[Shortlist 2012/G8]Let $ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\omega$ and $\ell$ a line without common points with $\omega$. Denote by $P$ the foot of the perpendicular from the center of $\omega$ to $\ell$. The side-lines $BC,CA,AB$ intersect $\ell$ at the points $X,Y,Z$ different from $P$.
