        <h1>Some geometers' apology</h1>
            As the title suggests, I/we  "propose to put forward an apology" in emulation of Hardy's essay of similar
            title   -- <i>this is why we still do geometry.</i>
        <h2>Artistics</h2>
            <p>Yes, this may be a thousands-years-old subject, often dealt with today using very recent
                <a href="https://geogebra.org/classic">computer software</a> or
                <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/handouts/bary/bary-full.pdf">algebraic methods</a>, but it can never lose
                its aesthetic taste.
                By default when people say `art' they mean painting and/or drawing. Much less people would think of the art of
                essays.
                Geometry is to math what painting and drawing are to art.</p>
            <p>Geometry may be gone from olympiads, but it will aways remain in our hearts: nobody can deny the
            unspeakable beauty of tessellations or of theorems like Pascal or Desargues's invo</p>
            <h2>Uselessness</h2>
            <p>In the past, it was geometry that was used every turn: aiming cannons, constructing structures like temples
                or forums. The other three subjects were relegated to recreation in the form of 'numbers puzzles'.</p>
                <p>Today, the tables have flipped: algebra is used in ,combinatorics is used in CS, and number theory is used in
            cryptography. By contrast, geometry has become an art and an art only. For, nobody judges a Picasso painting
            by its applications to business (apart from its monetary value?).</p>

            <h2>Ending remarks</h2>
            <p>I too find writing about math a "melancholic experience"-- <i>perhaps the time spent writing this
            would  be better spent doing geometry itself...</i></p>
