        <div id="main"><h1>Technique tiles (or attempt thereof)</h1>
        <p>We tried a variety of surface designs on square (3" x 3" x .25"?) tiles. There are so many differently useful ways to UG (underglaze) / glaze a piece of clay...
            (Probably, those techniques are easiest/most essential?) </p>
        <h2>Inspiration: general</h2>
        <p>The projects weren't too complicated, so I went with the first sensible idea off the top of my head.</p>
        
        <h2>Sgraffito</h2>
        A "subtractive technique", where upper layers of UG are partially scratched away on leather-hard clay, revealing the lower layers.
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Mainly the abundance of grid problems in math olympiads. 
            I immediately thought of a few recent problems, and settled on <a href="https://aops.com/community/c6h3098737p28015682">this one</a>, aka TSTST 2023/3.
        This one haunts me in particular since I vividly remember being stumped by it during the actual test. 
        Another reason I chose that picture was because two colors and a not-very-precise picture meant there was room for error.
        </p>
        <h3>Dev't (aka commentary)</h3>
        <p>
            <li>I forgot to put the clay in an airtight container, so it was hard (pun intended) to work with the next day as greenware.</li>
            <li>Had to glaze a second time;</li>
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <h3>Reflect</h3>
        <p>It didn't turn out the absolute worst, but in the spirit of self-criticism, a few things to be improved:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Clay was not kept moist.</b> Instead of asking for / using Ziploc bags, I wrapped my WIPs in plastic wrap, which completely failed to preserve moisture.
            In later projects I made sure to bag every single work.</li>
            <li><b>UG was excessive,</b> to the point where there were very visible cracks. (I still don't know how to apply it properly oops)</li>
            <li><b>Glaze applied insufficiently.</b> Patches of the transparently-glazed tile were visibly rough, and felt like (and were basically) bisqueware. 
                <br>Resolved by clear-glazing again; in later projects, must copiously apply glaze.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Slip trail</h2>
        <p>For us, used a squirt bottle containing slip to spray a design. (Slip is a fancy word for watered-down clay, and is used as glue.
            As an example one might repair a broken work of clay with that.)</p>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Wanted something simple yet non-math. I thought of my friend's <a href="https://gitlab.com/chennisden/tex/bounce">LaTeX template</a>, and found it 
            not completely trivial to make.</p>
        <h3>Dev't</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Used slip squirt bottle as instructed. Design involved intersecting circles;</li>
            <li>intersection areas were too "high"  / "thick", hence had to scrape away the excess slip there.</li>
        </ul>
        Everything after greenware was quite routine seeing as little glossing was involved except for one clear glaze layer.
        <h3>Reflect</h3>
        <p>At time of making, still hadn't placed soft, moist clay in airtight containers. As the clay was left in a non-airtight locker for a day, it was <i>hard</i> to "smooth" the tops
            of the thing. </p>

        <h2>Wax resist</h2>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Wanted something not too complicated, but nonmath again. I suddenly thought of the the "electric" banner at the end of a certain 
            <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Black_and_White_Versions">video game</a>. 
            This also would mean a limited amount of needed wax resist...</p>
        <h3>Dev't</h3>
        <p>Everything went according to plan.</p>
        <h3>Reflect</h3>
        <p>Still things to work on.
        <ul>
            <li>UG not applied evenly. To this day, I still don't know how. As a result, slight feel-able unevenness after completion.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Monoprint</h2>
        <p>To spare us ceramic artists the pain of having to paint a design onto some surface directly (like a curved vase surface, say), monoprint 
            exists to save the day- paint it on a piece of newsprint with UG, then transfer it to any one surface! Single-use only.
        </p>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>I asked my teacher what kinds of things were used for monoprint, to which the response was rather precise designs. Hence, my math brain immediately thought of 
            fractals. Since tiles are squares, I had to pick a square fractal, and I did the first thing that came to mind as a design- Sierpinski's carpet.
        </p>
        <h3>Dev't</h3>
        <p>Went as instructed. I was almost going to slap on another layer of white UG, when my teacher observed that bisqueware/glazeware is already white. 
            So, I was spared the burden of adding another layer! 
            The newsprint I used:
            <img src="./newsprint.JPG" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:auto;"
            class="center" />
            Printing had some errors (think of a bad toner); corrected by adding UG directly in missing / weak spots.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflect</h3>
        <p>Went rather smoothly. Some things to improve:
        <ul>
            <li>Tile wasn't completely flat (again); have yet to discover a solution...</li>
            <li>Accidental UG drops of other colors; could've cleaned nearby paintbrushes...</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
