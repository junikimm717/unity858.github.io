        <div id="main"><h1>Technique tiles (or attempt thereof)</h1>
        <p>We tried a variety of surface designs on square (3" x 3" x .25"?) tiles. There are so many differently useful ways to UG (underglaze) / glaze a piece of clay...
            (Probably, those techniques are easiest/most essential?) </p>

        <h2>Sgraffito</h2>
        A "subtractive technique", where upper layers of UG are partially scratched away on leather-hard clay, revealing the lower layers.
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Mainly the abundance of grid problems in math olympiads.
        </p>
        <h3>Dev't (aka commentary)</h3>
        <p>
        I immediately thought of a few recent problems, and settled on <a href="https://aops.com/community/c6h3098737p28015682">this one</a>, aka TSTST 2023/3.
        This one haunts me in particular since I vividly remember being stumped by it during the actual test. 
        Another reason I chose that picture was because two colors and a not-very-precise picture meant there was room for error.</p>
        <h3>Create</h3>
        <p>why the heck am i so bad</p>
        <h3>Reflect</h3>
        <p>It didn't turn out the absolute worst, but in the spirit of self-criticism, a few things to be improved:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Clay was not kept moist.</b> Instead of asking for / using Ziploc bags, I wrapped my WIPs in plastic wrap, which completely failed to preserve moisture.
            In later projects I made sure to bag every single work.</li>
            <li><b>UG was excessive,</b> to the point where there were very visible cracks. (I still don't know how to apply it properly oops)</li>
            <li><b>Glaze applied insufficiently.</b> Patches of the transparently-glazed tile were visibly rough, and felt like (and were basically) bisqueware. 
                <br>Resolved by clear-glazing again; in later projects, must copiously apply glaze.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Slip trail</h2>
        <p>For us, used a squirt bottle containing slip to spray a design. (Slip is a fancy word for watered-down clay, and is used as glue.
            As an example one might repair a broken work of clay with that.)</p>
        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
        <p>Wanted something simple yet non-math. I thought of my friend's <a href="https://gitlab.com/chennisden/tex/bounce">LaTeX template</a></p>

        insert more filler text </p>
