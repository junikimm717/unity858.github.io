        <p>In ceramics class in school, we aren't graded on the objective quality of our work, as I'd be getting straight zeros under such a system. Instead, we're graded
            on the "process", for which we've to make a simple static page with our thoughts and work in progress plus a reflection.
        I'd rather not use Adobe Express to put up a webpage...</p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Fav project</b> Like probably many students, I found the cylinder throwing fun. 
                Still need to learn to do things like adding the right amount of water and not spinning the wheel too fast, though...</li>
            <li><b>Favorite handbuilding technique</b> Score and slip, despite its simplicity, seems to work far better than school glue does for paper.</li>
            <li><b>Custom project ideas list</b>, except looks like I am not very creative oops..
                <ul>
                    <li>Model of a Pok√©mon? Would look like a statue and be mostly based on handbuilding techniques...</li>
                    <li>Replica of household object, like a pair of headphones. Unsure what kind of object would be fitting to remake in clay.</li>
                    <li>Asian-style teapot + cup- I've seen these in too many restaurants annd thought them no longer beyond my techniques.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Spring '24</h2>
