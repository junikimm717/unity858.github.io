        <h2>Reflect</h2>
        <p>It didn't turn out the absolute worst, but in the spirit of self-criticism, a few things to be improved:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Clay was not kept moist.</b> Instead of asking for / using Ziploc bags, I wrapped my WIPs in plastic wrap, which completely failed to preserve moisture.
            In later projects I made sure to bag every single work.</li>
            <li><b>UG was excessive,</b> to the point where there were very visible cracks. (I still don't know how to apply it properly oops)</li>
            <li><b>Glaze applied insufficiently.</b> Patches of the transparently-glazed tile were visibly rough, and felt like (and were basically) bisqueware. 
                <br>Resolved by clear-glazing again; in later projects, must copiously apply glaze.</li>
        </ul>
