        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>My own drinking cup at home, which was made of porcelain. Unlike the slabs we had, my actual drinking cup had walls that were quite thin...
            Also inspired by that cup, I tried to add a handle...
        </p>
        <h2>Dev't (aka commentary)</h2>
        <p>Had to smooth out clay cracks, but did a rough job; apart from that, business as usual, since shaping was otherwise not much of an issue. 
            Attaching the handle went smoothly as well.
        </p>
        <h2>Create</h2>
        <p>oops</p>
        <img src="./cup.jpg" style="width:50%; display:block; margin:auto;"
        class="center" />
        <h2>Reflect</h2>
        <p>honestly went quite bad..
        <ul>
            <li>glaze bleeding, etc; need to do the stripe in UG not glaze.</li>
            <li>only applied 1 layer of glaze oops; also remedied by reglazing.</li>
            <li>tried smoothing the lateral side's cracks too hard; solution is to use even moister clay?</li>
            <li>handle was too thick and I pressed it too hard against the cup's side;</li>
        </ul>
