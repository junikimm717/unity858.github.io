<h1>Youth EUCLID | About</h1>    
<p>Youth EUCLID Association (better known locally as "YEA") is an in-person math org located in East Bay, California, founded by 
Justin Lee (eisirrational) and Sean Li (Th3Numb3rThr33) and their parents. <br>
 (Yes, it even owns two buildings lmao)</p>
 <p>We've hosted many of today's renowned math students, including several MOPpers. 
    Also, we've sent teams and winning awards to various college math contests
    , including a sweep of CHMMC 2021.

 <h2>Mock contests</h2>
 <p>These aren't the highest quality, but I'm trying to change that... sadly my problem
    pool is narrowly limited though...</p>
<h3>MLK Day AIME's</h3><p>
In an attempt to make the test more interesting, silly things have been done,
not the least of which is unusual contest appellations and flavortext. Making references
can be funny sometimes...<br>
I think it was decided to hold these tests all on MLK days because nobody has school then...</p>

        <b>Top N < 5:</b> as this test is computational, score distributions are TMI and thus omitted.

    I don't have access to the form so I can't put much here. I only wish I 
    had more geometric ideas back then...
