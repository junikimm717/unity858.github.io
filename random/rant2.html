            <h1>A Youth EUCLID Lament</h1>
            <div id="quote">

            <p>I have nowhere better to place this than on my website, but it saddens me to realize
                that everyone either doesn't know our org is dying or doesn't care. (Or both.)<br>Maybe it's
                about time the legacy of the founders <b>eisirrational</b> and <b>Th3Numb3rThr33</b>
                cease to show signs of existence.</p>
            <h2>Formality</h2>
            <p>For some reason, our organization's president talks (i.e. chat, not announcement)
                on Discord normally half of the time, then abruptly switches to proper English.</p>
            <p>
                We also hold weekly and monthly meetings, which are dead and forced, respectively. In the former,
                a variable high-school student gives a lecture to a black screen that's supposed to be a Zoom room,
                while in the latter, another student runs through a pile of empty Google Slides at Mach 5,
                skipping human-to-human interaction (besides occasional private messages!)
                in favor of ending the meeting as early as possible.
            </p>
            <p>We'll be holding a TSTST for BMT 2022 in October. Too bad, a certain someone said that
                the legal owner of HQ (the retired president's father) will be ignoring us, denying us entry
                to HQ to host an irl contest for once in three years. Why?
                <block><b>Quote (in proper English on Discord, sic):</b> "The monthly meeting will be held virtually, as our
                    officers are spread out across the Bay Area. There are some on the peninsula and several are in the
                    South Bay too. It is not worth a 2-hour trip for a 1-hour meeting. Although, it would be a good idea
                    to have an in-person meeting during Thanksgiving or Christmas break."
                </block>
                In short, "pls use some common sense already". We need initiative, and parent-operated
                puppets simply won't do.
            </p>
            <h2>Socials</h2>
            <p>No officer got to know any other officer through operating remote activities. (Instead,
            this happened via math tournaments or private chats.)</p>
            <p>I think that this type of activity is eschewed for irrelevance to math or bureaucracy,
            resulting in the disinterest of our organization's members.<br>
            We (as an org) are basically trying to operate with one foot in WeChat and the other foot in the 1970s.</p>
            <h2>Media presence</h2>
            <p>Probably the shortest section of the rant: "no website, no AoPS, barely-existent IG,
            etc etc." <br>
            (Well, those may have existed in the past, but we didn't get beyond making
            a dead site off of a Wix template.)</p>
            <h2>Own remarks</h2>
            <p>To revive the org, there are a few things that need to be done besides directly changing
                the things mentioned above:
            <ol>
            <li>Take power out of the hands of the adults, no offense;</li>
            <li>Get rid of some unnecessary branches (won't name names); </li>
            <li>Make classes more dynamic, instead of the same monotonous thing every single week.
            (I personally know what some teachers do along this line.)</li>
        </ol></p>
            <p>Thankfully, I'm in other, more-alive bureaucracies like OMMC, so in the future when my
            reforms are handily rejected by those fearing their power will be compromised,
            at least I'll have a way out.</p>
